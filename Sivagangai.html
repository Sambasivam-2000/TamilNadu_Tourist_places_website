        <p>Vettangudi Bird Sanctuary is a 0.384 km2 (0.148 sq mi) protected area, declared in June 1977 near Thirupattur in the Sivaganga District that includes the periya kollukudi patti, chinna kollukudi patti, and vettangudi patti irrigation tanks.

        <h2>IDAIKATTUR CHRUCH:</h2>
        <img src="The Sacred Heart Shrine sivagangai.JPG" alt="Camp"width="30%"height="40%">
        <p> Idaikattur is a village in Sivaganga. It is at a distance of 37 kms towards the Madurai on the Madurai â€“ Rameswaram national highway. This unique Church of the Sacred Heart of Jesus was built in Gothic Architectural Style in the year 1894 AD by a French missionary Fr. Ferdinand Cells SJ. This is a replica of the Rheims Cathedral in France. Since the church was said to be built by angels, Fr.Ferdinand Celle SJ has placed 153 depictions of angels in and around the church Another powerful source we have in this church to get the great divine help is the relics of 40 saints kept on the altar. It is constructed with 200 different types of moulded bricks and tiles in lime marty. They are used for its decoration. The inner gothic arches rest over the columns embedded with ribs, its corner rising up to the vaulted roof. The widows are decorated with small brick pillars adjoined with hollow flower bricks and stained glass works which depicts the events of the journey of the cross colorfully and beautifully. Since South India is a tropical country, utilization of the hollow bricks in the construction, reduces the heat and also the vacuum gap between inner vaulted roof makes and air-conditioned system below the shelter of the wall. The stucco figures and the statues of Saint, Angels and the sacred Heart of Jesus, his foster father St.Joseph and the Holy Family Statue with golden gilt and the Mother of Sorrows are of great beauty and symbol of ancient French art work.</p>
